# ComputerScience 30 Final Project - City Escape Game
The general idea of this game is to ahve a player run around a procedurally generated map and try to escape before the zombies infect and catch them. The zombies have the ability to also infect civilians around them so as time goes on, the map will be harder to escape with more zombies.

Environment -
	The game takes place in a procedurally generated city. The city will will be made up of multiple grids that would interlock with other grids. Modular buildings would be procedurally placed. As a result a procedurally generated city would be created.

Human - 
	A playable character would be placed into a random position within a the procedurally generated city. The player would have to fight there way to escape a city that is dealing with a zombie outbreak. The player would be played in VR.

NPC - 
	The city will be populated two different kinds of NPCs. A civilian NPC and a zombie NPC. the civilian NPC would attempt to run from zombies. Zombies will try to convert civilians into zombies and to kill the player.
