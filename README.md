# ComputerScience 30 Final Project - City Escape Game
The general idea of this game is to have a player run around a procedurally generated map and try to escape before the zombies infect and catch them. The zombies have the ability to also infect civilians around them so as time goes on, the map will be harder to escape with more zombies. However due to time constraints and unforeseen issues. The game was modified in an infection simulator in a procedurally generated city.

Environment -
	The game takes place in a procedurally generated city. The city will be made up of multiple grids that would interlock with other grids. Modular buildings would be procedurally placed. As a result, a procedurally generated city would be created.

Player - 
	A controllable camera that allows the player to observe the simulation.

NPC - 
	The city will be populated two different kinds of NPCs. A civilian NPC and a zombie NPC. the civilian NPC would attempt to run from zombies. Zombies will try to convert civilians into zombies and to kill the player.
